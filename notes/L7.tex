\section{Evolutionary Computation}
Evolutionary Computation is the area of computer science interested in optimising solutions to problems that are often NP-hard, by using nature as the inspiration to for the techniques.
\subsection{Formal definition}
Given an optimisation problem $f(x)$, find a solution $x$ that optimises the function $f$. When the search space is simple this is not a very hard problem see figure \ref{fig:x^2}, whereas for search space is often not that nice!
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw[->] (-3,0) -- (3,0) node[right] {$x$};
      \draw[->] (0,-3) -- (0,5) node[above] {$y$};
      \draw[scale=0.5,domain=-3:3,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot ({\x},{\x*\x});
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{$f(x) = x^2$}
    \label{fig:x^2}
\end{figure}

To optimise a problem we must consider a few very important things about the solution
\begin{itemize}
    \item representation 
    \item evaluation of quality
    \item illegal solutions are not generated
    \item they are generated from scratch
    \item modify
    \item a way to identify the best one
\end{itemize}
